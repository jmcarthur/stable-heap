-- Stability   :  experimental
--
-- This module provides an implementation of stable heaps, or fair
-- priority queues. The data structure is a fairly simple tweak to the
-- lazy pairing heaps described in Chris Okasaki's /Purely Functional Data Structures/.
--
-- Due to its stability, a 'Heap' has both heap-like and sequence-like
-- properties. Most of the traversals defined in this module work in
-- sequence order; those that work in key order are explicitly
-- documented as such.
--
-- Unless stated otherwise, the documented asymptotic efficiencies of
-- functions on 'Heap' assume that arguments are already in WHNF and
-- that the result is to be evaluated to WHNF.
