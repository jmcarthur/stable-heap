-- Stability   :  experimental
--
-- A simple implementation of stable heaps (fair priority queues),
-- modeled as a sequence of key-value pairs, allowing duplicates, with
-- efficient access to the leftmost key-value pair having the smallest
-- key.
--
-- The data structure is a modification of the lazy pairing heaps
-- described in Chris Okasaki's /Purely Functional Data Structures/.
--
-- A 'Heap' has both heap-like and sequence-like properties. Most of
-- the traversals defined in this module work in sequence order; those
-- that work in key order are explicitly documented as such.
--
-- Unless stated otherwise, the documented asymptotic efficiencies of
-- functions on 'Heap' assume that arguments are already in WHNF and
-- that the result is to be evaluated to WHNF.
