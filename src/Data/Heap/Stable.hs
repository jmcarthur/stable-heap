--
-- This module provides an implementation of stable heaps, or fair
-- priority queues. The data structure is technically original, but is
-- really a fairly small tweak to the lazy pairing heaps described in
-- /Purely Functional Data Structures/, by Chris Okasaki.
--
-- Unless stated otherwise, the documented asymptotic efficiencies of
-- functions on 'Heap' assume that arguments are already in WHNF and
-- that the result is to be evaluated to WHNF.
