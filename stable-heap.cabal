synopsis:            Purely functional stable heaps (fair priority queues)
description:
        This library provides a purely functional implementation of
        stable heaps (fair priority queues). The data structure is a
        cousin of the pairing heap, but it maintains a sequential
        ordering of the keys. Insertion can be to either end of the
        heap, as though it is a deque, and it can be split on the
        left-most occurrence of the minimum key.
